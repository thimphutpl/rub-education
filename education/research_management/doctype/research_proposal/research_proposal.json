Second, provide some historical background, if any. Thirdly, discuss the modern context, wherein the research will be central. Finally, refer briefly to the most significant recent publications (the full literature review is separate).\nThe problem statement, which may be in the introduction in an appropriate place, serves to: (1) Introduce the reader to the importance of the problem. The reader is oriented to the significance of the study and the research questions or hypotheses to follow; (2) Place the problem in a context; (3) Provide the framework for reporting the results; and (4) Indicate what is probably necessary to conduct the study and explain how the findings will present this information.     \n",
